Matrix Caching
========================================================

This simply demonstrates the use of caching helpers for the 2nd R programming assignment.

```{r}
source('cachematrix.R')
myMat = rbind(c(1, -1/4), c(-1/4, 1))
class(myMat)
myMatCache <- makeCacheMatrix(myMat)
# first call, inverse matrix is computed and not pulled from cache
cacheSolve(myMatCache)
# second call, inverse matrix is pulled from cache
cacheSolve(myMatCache)
```
